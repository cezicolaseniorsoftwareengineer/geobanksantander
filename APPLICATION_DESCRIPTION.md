## Architecture Principles

### Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Adapter Pattern**: External system integration
- **Strategy Pattern**: Algorithm selection for business rules
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven notifications

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable
- **Interface Segregation**: Client-specific interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
